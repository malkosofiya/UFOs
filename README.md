# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create a HTML webpage to hold a variety of data related to UFO sightings. The data has been displayed as a table using JavaScript. Additionally, a range of filters have been added in order to facility different search criteria.

  * Navigation Bar
  * Page Header
  * Article Title
  * Article Paragraph
  * Filters for the Table

Users is able to filter data, simply by inputting a criterion into one of the filter fields. In the first example below, the data has been filtered by city "el cajon". In the second example, shape filter has been updated to only show "sphere" sightings.

## Summary

### Drawback:

One of the disadvantages of current webpage design is that the filter criteria is not very intuitive for the first-time users. Every search criterion must be typed in lower case to match table data exactly. For example, if user types "elcajon" or "El Cajon" instead of "el cajon" there will be no display even though this city had some sightings. Please see example below:

Recommendations:

A useful update to the webpage can allow users to input date as a range filter, not only a single date (For example: "1/10/2010 - 1/12/2010").
Additionally, a dropdown filter menu can be a great further addition. It can allow users to see filter options that otherwise might not be so obvious (For example "light" as a shape).
